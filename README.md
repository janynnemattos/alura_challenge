<h1 align="left">About the project #alura_challenge</h1>

<p align="justify">Hello everyone, I am glad you are here today.
This project had the main goal simulate a real development environment.
The challenge happened for 4 weeks, starting on 17th May 2021.</p>

<h2 align="left">What was the goal?</h2>

<p align="justify">The goal was developing a website where the "client" will be able to insert, edit, save, and share his code. During the project, I started implementing new features to be more functional, intuitive and fun.</p>

<h2 align="left">Tools</h2>

<p align="justify">The page was marked with HTML5. The style was made with CSS3. And the functions were made with JavaScript.
I also used the plugin highlight.js to highlight the code.</p>

<h2 align="left">Who coded this project?</h2>

<p align="justify">As I said this project was born from a challenge. The design was pre-concept on Figma and after that, all coding was made by me.</p>

<h2 align="left">The result?</h2>

If you still here, I would like to share and register for the future my experience about this challenge. I discovered that no matter how much you know, it's always possible to learn even more. The community of developing is amazing. If it's not working, try again. Sometimes only works at your machine. There are many ways to do the same thing. Don't give up!
